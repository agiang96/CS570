I adapted this program from Foster's inout2.c file,
otherwise I wrote this code myself. 

I believe everything works perfectly under all conditions.  

I believe you should include the necessary requirements 
inside the program0.txt file, such as the documentation 
requirement to include the CS570 or Carroll. This is only
explicitly stated in the autograder, but should also be
stated in the program0.txt requirements.
