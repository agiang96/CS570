I adapted getword.c from Foster's inout2.c file, and some of the code was 
adapted from Dr. John Carroll's Course Reader notes. I also found a source
where I drew some ideas from: 
    https://github.com/connorguy/SDSU_CS_570_CARROLL/tree/master/Two
Otherwise I wrote this code myself. 

For the input echo >&, 

I believe this program does not work perfectly under all conditions. Piping has 
some problems and the 'p2: ' prompt behavior does not follow the example outputs
of the autograder and I'm not sure why.
